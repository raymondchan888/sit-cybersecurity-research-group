The Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and the [ISACA Singapore Chapter](https://engage.isaca.org/singaporechapter/home "ISACA Singapore Chapter") have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on activities spanning areas such as academic awards, student development, as well as talks and workshops.

This paves the way for students of SIT to expand their opportunities for real-world experience, whether through ideas for Capstone collaborations or assisting in seminars and conferences organised by ISACA. As a professional association focused on IT governance, risk, audit and cybersecurity, ISACA’s network of professionals can share their considerable knowledge and insights on information technology, information security and innovation, to support SIT’s efforts in preparing graduates for an increasingly digital world.

Professor John Thong, Deputy President (Academic) & Provost, SIT said, “The role of the infocomm technology professional is evolving constantly and there is a strong need for local talent to be equipped with the necessary knowledge and skillsets. We are appreciative of the contribution from ISACA that will support SIT to produce work-ready graduates. Our students will benefit from the early industry exposure and applied learning opportunity that ISACA provides.”

Mr Peter Gwee, local chair of Young Leaders in Tech (part of ISACA One In Tech Foundation initiatives) and director of academic outreach at the ISACA Singapore Chapter, said, “ISACA Singapore has industry professionals who promote the ‘positive’ aspects of technology and the importance of adopting good and effective governance in the digital and cyber domains; thereby attracting the attention of government leaders, stimulating new ideas for industry and cited by academic authors' profiles in education for lifelong learning.”

President of the ISACA Singapore Chapter, Steven Sim, added, “In this era of accelerated Industry 4.0, good domain expertise is crucial to achieve resilience by design in every industry. ISACA Singapore with its large membership base of experienced cyber leaders is glad to partner with SIT in skilling up the future cyber leaders of Singapore.”

According to Dr. Chris Dimitriadis, Chief Global Strategy Officer at ISACA Global, “Skills gaps continue to persist in technology and cybersecurity roles. Through relationships like these, we better equip students, thereby better equipping organizations with the talent and knowledge they need to power innovation through trusted and secure technology.”
