## <span style="font-size: 1.25rem  ;">**Biography**</span>
<span style="font-size: 0.9rem  ;">Dr Weihan Goh is an Assistant Professor at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), where he teaches primarily in the Information Security degree programme. His teaching and research interests include security testing and digital forensics, as well as technologies for cybersecurity education such as cyber ranges, CTF / CDX, and anti-fraud / anti-cheat systems. He leads the GoSecure vulnerability assessment programme funded by the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA), and is a Kaspersky Academy certified instructor on Malware Reverse Engineering and Analysis.

Beyond research, Dr Goh also participates in capture-the-flag exercises, and have mentored student teams participating in cybersecurity hackathons to successes both locally and internationally. Dr Goh received his PhD and BEng, both in Computer Engineering, from the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2013 and 2008 respectively. He goes by the CTF handler 'icebear'.</span>
