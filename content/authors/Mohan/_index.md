Dr. Purnima believes that a gratifying way to drive lifelong learning experience in an academic's life is through teaching and interacting with young students, who are progressively stepping into the real world. She obtained her Doctorate and Master's degrees in Communication Engineering from the National University of Singapore (NUS).  She has expertise in Layer 2 and Layer 3 network protocols while working in the industry with Aricent/Altran Group --- TELLABS datacom development, Finland.  Her current research areas include Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network Function Virtualization, and 5G Networks, focusing on Resilience, Traffic engineering, Secure routing, Optimization programming, and Heuristics design.

During her Postdoctoral research at NUS,  she has gained experience in machine learning algorithms to enable automation of next-generation networks. Given her strong theoretical foundation in the SDN architecture, she has also got practical experience in bringing-up and configuring industry-grade SDN switches. She has been extensively publishing in the area of communication networks in Tier-1 conferences and high impact factor journals while remaining as an active reviewer of IEEE and Elsevier Transactions.
