Dr. Malcolm Yoke Hean Low is currently an Associate Professor with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), and a member of the SIT Systems Section (S3). Prior to joining SIT, he was the Vice President (Aerospace) with D-SIMLAB Technologies. In 2006, Malcolm joined the Nanyang Technological University as an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Engineering where he led large-scale simulation and optimization research projects in the defence and maritime domains funded by the Singapore Ministry of Defence and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. Prior to this, he was with the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology where he executed simulation-based optimization projects with multinational companies.

He is a Senior Member of the IEEE and ACM, and was the principal investigator of a Singapore Ministry of Defence funded project on “Evolutionary Computing Methodologies for Modelling, Simulation and Analysis” under the Defence Innovation Research Programme, as well as the principal investigator in the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and APL funded research project on “Optimization of Stowage Plans for Large Containerships”. He has extensive experience in modelling and simulation, planning and scheduling, as well as parallel computing. His current research interest is in the application of parallel/distributed simulation, grid computing and agent technology for the modelling, simulation, analysis and optimization of complex systems.
