<span style="font-size: 0.9rem  ;">Dr. Tram Truong-Huu is an Assistant Professor at Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), Infocomm Technology (ICT) Cluster. He is currently holding a joint appointment with Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) where he has worked as a computer scientist at Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) since May 2019. He received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Nice - Sophia Antipolis (now Côte d'Azur University), France in December 2010. From January 2011 to June 2012, he held a post-doctoral fellowship at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), France. He worked at the National University of Singapore as a research fellow from July 2012, then senior research fellow from January 2017. His research interests include software-defined networks, Internet of Things, and application of artificial intelligence to cybersecurity. He won the Best Presentation Recognition at IEEE/ACM UCC 2013. He is a member of the IEEE since 2012 and Senior Member of the IEEE since 2015.</span>
