summary: Identify security gaps in their products and solutions through vulnerability assement
---

***In partnership with IMDA and supported by CSA, we introduced the GoSecure programme to promote and develop cybersecurity  capabilities within local enterprises. This programme helps local companies to identify security gaps in their products and solutions through vulnerability assessment to reduce cybersecurity risks. The GoSecure programme was executed through Verbosecurity Pte Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the University.***
