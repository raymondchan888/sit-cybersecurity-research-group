**The Building Management System (BMS) performs vulnerability assessments on selected IoT devices. It utilizes a unique isolation methodology, in conjunction with devices' auto-recovery features. With real-time MQTT logging and an abnormal detection framework, the BMS effectively counters cyber threats and attacks.**

Building Management System is one of the essential critical infrastructure. It includes different subsystems like, water supply management system, power monitoring system and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. Recently, integrating Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to improve the BMS has become a trend. Different protocols like MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) has been widely used inside the BMS as the preferred communication protocol when integrated with IoT devices. However, these subsystems are isolated from each other which poses the challenge of managing them. Each subsystem has an individual platform and separated dashboard of its own that is used to manage the particular system. Therefore, it is challenging to monitor Cyber-attacks targeting on a specific subsystem due to the lack of visibility. In this project, we propose a Proof-Of-Concept (POC) security enhanced BMS orchestration platform. It ingests information from various BMS subsystems, and IoT devices to collect BMS activities. A devices auto recovery and isolation methodology and a real-time MQTT logging and abnormal detection framework with push notifications have been introduced and integrated into the BMS orchestration platform to migrate cyber threats and attacks.
